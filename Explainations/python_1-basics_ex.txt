# Variable Declaration
"""Rules for variable declaration:
    Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
    They cannot start with a number.
    Names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
    Variable names are case-sensitive (Age and age are different).

"""Data Types:
    Integers (int): Whole numbers, e.g., 10, -5
    Floating-point numbers (float): Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -7.5
    Strings (str): Textual data enclosed in quotes, e.g., "Hello", 'Python'
    Booleans (bool): Represents True or False
    None: Represents a null or undefined value, using the keyword None
